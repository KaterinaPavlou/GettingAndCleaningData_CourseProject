Getting and Cleaning Data : Course Project
========================================================


In this repository you can find all the files related to the Course Project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course. Apart from this README.md file there are also listed:

* The R script run_analysis.R which downloads, reads, transforms the original data and creates the tidy data set.
* CodeBook.md which described the tidyDataSet.txt and lists the transformations that took place
* The tidy data set generated by the R script above: tidyDataSet.txt

To run this code, you first need to download it locally, set the location as your working directory and run the command:

```
source("run_analysis.R")

```

This will run everything that is needed to create the tidy data set in your working directory.

**NOTE 1:** You do not need to have the data in your local working directory as the script will download them from the source. It is suggested though for security reasons (in case the data are removed from the site) and for consistency (in case the data change in the future, the analysis will give different results) to maintain a local copy of the data. If a local copy is available the first download commands can be skipped and one can directly go to the reading part.

**NOTE 2:** If there already exists a file named tidyDataSet.txt in your working directory after running this script, the file will be *overwritten* and all your previous changes will be lost.
